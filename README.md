The use of the layout was done on Chrome using the inspect tool to tweak to the desired effect.

### And coding style tests

Created the basic HTML and then added the internal comments breaking it up into sections depending on the type of page I planed on building.
Then I added the Bootstrap elements per page and ensured it was working with placeholders.
Added the RAW content to each page.
Then added the social media icons/links at the footer of each page.
Updated the README with the project built.
